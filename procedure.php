                                <br>A traumatic dental injury is damage caused to a tooth by an accident. Injuries can occur in auto accidents, while playing sports, as a result of a trip and fall accident, or from any direct blow to the mouth

                            <p>Itâ€™s normal to experience mild to moderate discomfort following endodontic treatment, especially when chewing. This is due to a healing response at the root ends and the injection sites and is completely normal.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Take the prescribed pain killers as per the doctors advise.</li>
                                <li>Be careful to avoid biting or burning your lip or cheek while your mouth is numb.</li>
                                <li>Softer foods are advisable in the first few days and avoid hot food for few days.</li>
                                <li>We recommend that you continue with good oral hygiene, tooth brushing, and flossing. </li>
                                <li>If you experience swelling or fever after the root canal therapy, if these symptoms occur, please contact us for further advice.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Depending on the condition of the tooth prior to the root canal treatment, the healing phase may take longer than predicted. Please be patient with this process as it can take several weeks, or occasionally longer, for a full resolution of symptoms. </p>
                            <p><b>At Roots Dental we have a very long follow up of all cases treated by means of evaluating the procedures by providing a complimentary radiograph (X-rays Evaluation of the tooth) annually.</b></p>
