                    <p>Traumatic dental injuries often occur in accidents or sports-related injuries. Chipped teeth account for the majority of all dental injuries. Dislodged or knocked-out teeth are examples of less frequent, but more severe injuries. Treatment depends on the type, location and severity of each injury. Any dental injury, even if apparently mild, requires examination by a dentist or an endodontist immediately. Sometimes, neighboring teeth suffer an additional, unnoticed injury that will only be detected by a thorough dental exam. Endodontists are dentists who specialize in treating traumatic dental injuries. With their advanced skills, techniques and technologies they can often save injured teeth. If you have a cracked or injured tooth, find an endodontist near you right away!  Most endodontists offer tremendous flexibility in accommodating emergency cases including weekends in some cases so your pain can be relieved quickly.</p>

            <p>As occasionally happens with any dental or medical procedure, a tooth may not heal as expected after initial treatment for a variety of reasons:</p>

                <li>Who performs endodontic treatment?</li>
                <li>How will my injury be treated?</li>
                <li>Do traumatic dental injuries differ in children?</li>
                <li>Will the tooth need any special care or additional treatment?</li>
                <li>What is endodontic treatment? </li>
            </ul>
             <p>Traumatic Dental Injuries“Endo” is the Greek word for “inside” and “odont” is Greek for “tooth.” Endodontic treatment involves the inside of the tooth.<br>To understand endodontic treatment, it helps to know something about the anatomy of the tooth. Inside the tooth, under the white enamel and a hard layer called the dentin, is a soft tissue called the pulp. The pulp contains blood vessels, nerves and connective tissue, and creates the surrounding hard tissues of the tooth during development.</p>
            <p>The pulp extends from the crown of the tooth to the tip of the roots where it connects to the tissues surrounding the root. The pulp is important during a tooth’s growth and development. However, once a tooth is fully mature it can survive without the pulp, because the tooth continues to be nourished by the tissues surrounding it.</p>
