                        <h2 class="margin-bottom">What are the alternatives to retreatment ?</h2>
                        If nonsurgical retreatment is not an option, then endodontic surgery should be considered. This surgery involves making an incision to allow access to the tip of the root. Endodontic surgery may also be recommended in conjunction with retreatment or as an alternative. <br><br>
                        <h2 class="margin-bottom">What are the alternatives to endodontic retreatment and/or endodontic surgery ?</h2>
                        The only other alternative is extraction of the tooth. The extracted tooth must then be replaced with an implant, bridge or removable partial denture to restore chewing function and to prevent adjacent teeth from shifting. Because these options require extensive surgery or dental procedures on adjacent healthy teeth, they can be far more costly and time consuming than retreatment and restoration of the natural tooth. No matter how effective tooth replacements areâ€”<b>nothing is as good as your own natural tooth. </b>
